# NBA Games Predictor

This Jupyter Notebook is part of the [Udacity Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/machine-learning-engineer-nanodegree--nd009t). In this project, an XGBoost model is created and trained in order to predict if the home team will win an NBA regular season game, achieving around 66% accuracy.

The dataset used in this Notebook was the [NBA Enhanced Box Score and Standings (2012 - 2018)](https://www.kaggle.com/pablote/nba-enhanced-stats/), available in Kaggle. Among the techniques used in this project, there is Principal Component Analysis and Data Normalization. Also, this Notebook is meant to be executed in a SageMaker environment, as it needs access to its API. For more details, please chech the Notebook and the project_report.pdf file.
